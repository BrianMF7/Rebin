## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **If Registration Doesn't Work:**

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Supabase environment variables are set
3. Check Supabase project is active
4. Verify database schema is applied

### **If Email Verification Doesn't Work:**

1. Check Supabase Auth settings
2. Verify email confirmation is enabled/disabled as expected
3. Check spam folder for verification emails
4. Verify redirect URLs are configured in Supabase

### **If Protected Routes Don't Work:**

1. Check browser console for authentication errors
2. Verify user is actually authenticated
3. Check if session is being maintained

### **If Redirects Don't Work:**

1. Check browser console for navigation errors
2. Verify React Router is working
3. Check if there are any JavaScript errors

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

‚úÖ **All tests pass when:**

- Registration works in both modes
- Login redirects properly
- Protected routes guard correctly
- Email verification works (if enabled)

- Logout clears authentication

## üö® **If Something Doesn't Work**

1. **Check Browser Console** - Look for JavaScript errors
2. **Check Network Tab** - Look for failed API calls
